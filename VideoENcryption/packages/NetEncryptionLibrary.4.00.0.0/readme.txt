Thank you for using Kellerman Software products.  The assemblies in this NuGet package can function as 
a trial version and also a licensed version.  The only difference is the use of a license key.  If 
you do not have a license key, you can try the software for 30 days and then an exception will be 
thrown indicating that the trial is expired.  If you have purchased a license key you gain the 
benefit of managing this library through NuGet.  Enjoy the software!
